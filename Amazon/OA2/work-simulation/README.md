## Q1: Schedule the design review meeting (1)
1 - We can take our best guess at an estimate on our own

2 - We should work for a couple of days to gauge our progress, and then complete our estimate from there

4 - We should consult a coworker who has more relevant experience on this type of task

3 - We should conduct our own investigation utilizing online research materials and internal documentation

5 - Let's ask our manager how we should go about developing an estimate


## Q2: Schedule the design review meeting (2)
3 - Ask all parties to identify a back-up person who could meet during a designated time

3 - See if there is a backup person on the Localization Team that can meet

5 - Set-up video conferencing to include all POC's regardless of their physical location

1 - Agree to postpone the design review for two weeks when all parties have more availability

2 - Discuss the design review over email

4 - Agree to schedule the meeting at Xavier's location an hour away


## Q3: Response to Ravi (1)
3 - We should miss the conference and increase the timeline to four weeks because we have four weeks of work

4 - Take a day to investigate whether adding additional resources would allow us to meet the original timeline, and re-evaluate afterwards

1 - Tell the Localization team if can't be done in the timeline, so we should go ahead with the US launch and delay the global launch even though it means adding an additional week of effort to the four week estimate

5 - Take two weeks to create a prototype of the feature to demo at the conference, then take the additional two weeks needed to fully complete the feature

2 - We can still hit the two week deadline without any changes by working harder and putting in overtime


## Q4: Response to Ravi (2)
Begin your investigation using the old error logs, but tell Ravi he will need to run the new logs if the old logs aren't useful


## Q5: Response to Aaron and Jacob (1)
Can you tell me more about what you're talking about?


## Q6: Response to Aaron and Jacob (2)
You said we have an internal database of both digital and physical books. How did we get the physical book data if the Book Database API doesn't give it to us?


## Q7: Response to Aaron and Jacob (3)
I recommend you go with Jacob's solution. We should miss the deadline to build our own service and meet all the requirements.


## Q8: Roadmap
Since you know more about the programming language than anyone else, you revise the estimate for porting to Java.


## Q9: Response to Nadia
What were the internal test case results?


## Q10: Most likely cause of German language issue
Site is using proxy server location to determine displayed language


## Q11: Most likely cause of invalid recommendation issue
Database field storing username is too short


## Q12: Log trace investivation success
5 - Increase time alotted for testing in overall lifecycle

5 - Update automated end-to-end tests to include broader data coverage

3 - Write more unit tests to include edge cases

3 - Have team members perform more manual testing before checking code in

1 - Increase the size of QA team

1 - Have more user testing in beta phase


## Q13: Response for meeting the deadline
2 - Work on the project on your own, putting in extra effort to finish on time

3 - Work on the project on your own until Priya is available, then continue to work on it together

4 - Work on the project with Ben, being sure to watch his work closely because of his lack of experience

5 - Tell your manager you will not be able to complete the project in the time avaliable

1 - Cut features from the product so you will be able to meet the two week deadline

3 - Start working on the project right away with Ben. Then ask Priya to contribute what she can when she is avaliable


## Q14: Response for completing this work on time
4 - Work with the Customer Incentives Team to identify the critical features that they need by the deadline, and focus on those

2 - Push the timeline back another week to ensure there is enough time for all work to be completed accurately

3 - Ask your whole team for help, explaining the urgency that another team is blocked

5 - Ask your manager for help in determining the best approach to meet the new deadline

1 - Put in extra hours yourself to make sure everything gets done on time


## Q15: Upgrade
4 - We should not perform this upgrade at this point in time. We promised the Retail Website Team we would have their new features complete by the proposed deadline. Let's postpone the upgrade to another time

2 - We should not perform the upgrade because it will not have a significant impact on the Retail Website Team's experience. We should focus on the Retail Website Team's requests

3 - We should not perform this upgrade at this point in time. Our top focus is meeting our agreed upon commitment with the Retail Website Team, so we should finish that first. We can focus on the upgrade afterwards by pushing our deadlines for some of our other projects

1 - I think we should perform the upgrade. The right thing to do is push back on the Retail Website Team because it will keep our team from having to do the same work twice

5 - I think we should perform the upgrade. As a compromise, we can include the gift recommendation feature the Retail Website Team wants by the deadline and then complete the upgrade. We can finish the seasonal-based gift recommendations feature after the deadline

2 - I think we should perform the upgrade. The right thing to do is push back on the Retail Website Team because it will allow us to more efficiently serve the customer and the customer will be helped in the long run.
